iOS impressions by a long-time Android User

I‚Äôll not talk about the hardware, this is incredibly good. I'd like to point where the iOS could be better for user experience.

## Apps are not sorted
Apps are displayed in the installation order, accumulated in many "desktops" to the right.
### The solution applied to minimize
Reading about it, I personally found the ‚ÄúApp Library" more useful than the default hell of icons.
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211345
Hold your finger in an empty space, and icons will start to dance (creepyüôÑ ) then click on the dots on the button of the screen (üôÑ terrible UX) 
Remove all possible desktops. Leave only the first one which cannot be removed
Doing that, the only available pages will be the news, swiping to the right, and the Apps Library by swiping to the left.
It will be much more useful to find the apps on the auto-categorized Apps Library than in the ocean of unsorted apps.

## Messed home screen
The home screen still is full of unuseful apps.
### The solution applied to minimize
After doing the solution for the ‚ÄúApps not sorted‚Äù, remove all the unuseful apps from the home screen. They don‚Äôt need to be necessarily uninstalled, though. Hold the home screen until the icons start to dance (creepyüôÑ ), and tap on the minus signal of each unwanted app. Select ‚ÄúRemove App‚Äù and then ‚ÄúRemove from the Home Screen‚Äù. (why so many steps, Apple? Your fame about best UX is it??)

## Lack of gestures
Shake to turn on the lantern
Twist to open the camera
Tree finger snapshot
Pickup to silence
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is. If you know something to make it besides the double-tap on the back, please drop me a line.

## Touchless gestures
OMG, I just realized hovering my hand over the iPhone that I was so used to them on my Z2 that I didn‚Äôt realize ‚Äúmodern phones‚Äù do not have them. That was useful with the hands dirty working in my shop or cooking in the kitchen to check the time, a countdown, answer and hang up a call without the need to touch messy dirty fingers. I‚Äôll miss that until I untrain my muscle memory. 
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is.

## Terrible back button
When an app opens another app, let‚Äôs say when you open a link from the Facebook app, a very tiny link shows up on the left top ear of the screen. It hides the previous app. What happens when you go to a third or fourth app? It stacks on the top 
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is.

## Too many steps to do simple things
I found the iOS way more laborious than my old Android 9. Remove an app, for instance, that takes 4 steps on iOS. On Android 9, just hold and drag to the garbage area, like one step.
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is.

## Positioning
Positioning apps and widgets are just painful. The system is based on sequential order, not as a grid, so you can‚Äôt just place an app icon at the button of the home screen, over the tray.
When you add a widget or an app to the home screen, very often it will be placed in a random place, messing with what you had previously arranged.
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is.

## Limited dock
The dock is the area stuck to the bottom of the screen like a tray for the most used apps. The thing is that only allows choosing 4 apps to be placed on it. Also, if one app is removed the remaining is not re-arranged.
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is. I saw something can be changed with jailbreak, but this is not an option on the table.
Also, I will try to place a folder, it can be a solution.

## Screenshot with scroll
When you need a screenshot of an app or webpage that has a little bit more content than the screen, there‚Äôs an option on Android to scroll during the screenshot. I couldn‚Äôt find it on the iPhone.
### The solution applied to minimize
None. If it has, maybe some iOS user can teach me.

## Contacts
Lack of intelligent functions on the contacts page, like Merge & fix, labels, and selection by account.
### The solution applied to minimize
None yet. I wish to have the Google Contacts app on iOS.

## Old UX experience
Most of the user interactions, menus and settings are like 90‚Äôs VB or Delphi applications, just a list of items one on top of each other, not user friendly, some of them in groups. I.e. settings, contact details, 

## Phone call
Well, this is still a telephone, isn‚Äôt it? To make a phone call, using the right way, is not a trivial task. 
If you have the phone number on a doc or web page (without a link) it‚Äôs not possible to copy and paste it into the phone app.

## FaceID - always blocked
FaceID is impressively good but is very exasperating to have to unlock again the phone when it was just unlocked and laid down on the table 30 seconds ago. 
### The solution applied to minimize
Changed the Auto-lock to 1 minute. It is not smart as the Android 9 features like presence and location, and Bluetooth recognition.

## App uninstall 
Right, you have just installed an app from the App Store and saw a second one that can fit better for what you need. So is just uninstall the first one. Hey, stop! Not from the App Store. It‚Äôs not possible to uninstall an app using the place that lists the available apps. Surprisingly it knows when an app is installed, showing an ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù instead of a ‚ÄúGet‚Äù button, but the app store cannot uninstall an app installed by it.
### The solution applied to minimize
None, it is what it is.

## Contact - how to delete
Why can that be soooo bad? This is another UX problem that is unbelievable from a company well known for its designs. There‚Äôs no quick action to delete a contact from the phone. To delete it from the contact list we need to find it in the contact list, tap to see the details, tap Edit, scroll all the way down and ta-dah! There it is, the delete option in bright red. Four or five taps to do a simple action.
It could be much easier on the long-press or swapping the contact like messages or notifications.
### The solution applied to minimize
None, on the phone it is what it is.

## Settings - mixed
The Settings app have a mix of phone, account and app settings, kinda weird when you are an app, let‚Äôs say the Camera app and just what to enable the Grid to help with the best shot. Although the Camera App has some settings and configurations on the screen, some settings are buried under the global settings of the phone.

## Camera resolution
I miss the option to change on-the-go the photo resolution for smaller files.

## Keyboard size
The native keyboard doesn‚Äôt have a size configuration, for me, it could be smaller.
### The solution applied to minimize
I have changed to the Microsoft SwiftKey keyboard, first because it brings my history of preferred words and sentences, and also with the hope to adjust the size but it also doesn‚Äôt have settings for keyboard size like the same app does on Android.

## Report Spam
Report spam on text messages or calls should be a default option. I miss the Google AI on it.
There is a feature to report junk and spam messages but the user has to go to the phone settings, find the messaging app in that huge (not sorted) list, and search for the option in a messed-up option list. How many users do this to help stop spammers? I bet not the majority.
### The solution applied to minimize
Enable the filtering option and deal with the known-unknown list. Not the best experience.
Also can‚Äôt do anything with the messages received before turning the message filter on.

The spam calls filter was delegated to third-party applications, I‚Äôll have to check on that:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099 

## Authenticator apps
Too many steps because of FaceID. To approve a VPN connection it requests that I take the phone and point at my face to unlock, face again to unlock the Authenticator app, tap on the ‚Äúapprove‚Äù message, and FaceID again on the approving. On the MotoZ the phone was on the table, when it received the notification I had to put one of my fingers on the biometry and tap on the approve button. 5 steps against 2.
### The solution applied to minimize
It‚Äôs possible to remove the App Lock on the Authenticator to reduce one step. 

## Audio destination
This is a really bad (lack of) feature, in my opinion. Imagine this scenario: your iPhone is paired to your car to answer and make calls, so every time you get in the car the Bluetooth magic happens beautifully. But it‚Äôs not possible to listen to the audio from any app if not using the car sound system. Parked, listening to the radio it‚Äôs not possible to play an audio message on Whatsapp, for example, because the Bluetooth is connected (for calls).

## Timer
The Clock App is missing a label on the Timer. Siri should ask what is the count down for.
Also should be possible to have more than one timer running, with different labels.

# What I found good

## FaceID
Good, fast. Could be better if accompanied by an onscreen finger sensor, because it doesn‚Äôt work in two, very usual, situations: when it is laid down on the table where the user is seated in front of it and when the user is wearing a mask. I know the mask thing is being improved by Apple, but it is not working for me right now.

## Screen Recorder
It cannot be done on Android natively. Maybe on newer versions.
The downside is that apparently, it does not record the audio.

## Control center
The quick access to some functions from the ‚Äúright ear‚Äù of the screen.
